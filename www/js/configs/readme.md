DON'T COMMIT THESE CONFIGS TO A PUBLIC GIT as they contain your IP (possibly your public IP) and your password.
That is unless you want people watching your naked butt while you're in your home/office/etc.  You have been warned!

You will want to create a somename-config.json file in this folder with something like the below.
Replace the IP, Pssword, Username, etc with your information.  1 config file per camera!

{
      "label": "camera1",
      "username": "dude",
      "password": "jkfljkljdfal",
      "port": "3000",
      "ip" : "192.168.1.123",
      "model" : "name_of_json_file.json"
}
